## Container

A `Container` is an abstraction of `View`. In most cases the `View` component is used in conjunction with some some simple layout styles like flexbox. With a Container these can just be added as props for declarative layouts. This is the most fundamental component in Kancha and can be used anywhere you would use a `View`.

## Card

A `Card` is build n top of `Container`. It inherits all of it's properties and has a border radius, border and shadow set by default.
